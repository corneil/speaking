human, male, husband, father, programmer, geek, Full Stack Architect and Software Engineer with #SkinInTheGame

I have earned a living by programming since 1985 and have worked on very small embedded systems as well as mainframe systems and everything in between.

I have used a wide variety of programming languages and technologies to solve problems across very different domains. Recently mostly on the JVM in financial services, and now at VMware on the Spring Cloud Data Flow team.

I am passionate about developer productivity and have a severe allergic reaction to bureaucracy.
